## 4. Payments & Platform Fees

### 4.1 Delivery Fee (100% Paid to Courier)
For each completed delivery, the Courier earns the full delivery fee paid by the customer.  
The current delivery fee is **$9.99 per order**, and **100% of this amount is allocated to the Courier**.

### 4.2 Tips
Customers may provide optional tips.  
Couriers receive **100% of all tips**, with no deductions taken by Peastash.

### 4.3 Platform Service Fee (Assessed at End of Shift)
To support use of the Peastash Platform, Couriers agree to pay Peastash a **platform service fee of $1.78 for each completed delivery**.

This fee is:

- Charged **after the Courier completes a shift**
- Calculated based on the number of successfully completed deliveries
- Separate from and **never deducted from customer-paid delivery fees or tips**
- Considered the cost of accessing the Peastash marketplace, dispatching system, support, and delivery infrastructure

### 4.4 Net Earnings Deposited to Courier’s Stripe Balance
At the end of each shift, Peastash will calculate:

- Total delivery earnings  
- Total tips earned  
- Total platform service fees owed  

Peastash will then deduct the total platform service fees and deposit the **net earnings** into the Courier’s Stripe Connect account balance.

Example:

If a Courier completes 5 deliveries in a shift:
- Delivery earnings: 5 × $9.99 = $49.95  
- Tips: $12.00  
- Platform fees: 5 × $1.78 = $8.90  
- **Net deposit:** $49.95 + $12.00 − $8.90 = $53.05  

### 4.5 Insufficient Balance
If the Courier’s Stripe balance is insufficient to cover the platform fees owed at shift-end, the outstanding amount will:

- Carry over to future shifts or payouts  
- Be deducted automatically once sufficient earnings are available  

Peastash reserves the right to temporarily suspend access until outstanding amounts are resolved.

### 4.6 Taxes
As an independent contractor, the Courier is solely responsible for:

- Federal, state, and local taxes  
- Self-employment taxes  
- Any required reporting obligations  

Peastash does not withhold taxes on the Courier’s behalf.

### 4.7 No Wage Relationship
Platform service fees are **not deductions from wages** and do not imply an employment relationship.  
Couriers receive the full customer delivery fee and tips before platform fees are assessed.
