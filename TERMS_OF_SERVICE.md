# Peastash Terms of Service

_Last Updated: November 15, 2025_

## 1. Introduction

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Peastash mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “**Peastash Platform**” or “**Platform**”). The Platform is operated by **The Candeed Corp**, a New Jersey corporation, doing business as **Peastash** (“**Peastash**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”).

By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use Peastash.

## 2. Description of the Service

Peastash is a marketplace and delivery facilitation platform that allows customers to:

- Browse menus from participating restaurants;
- Place food and beverage orders directly with those restaurants;
- Request delivery fulfilled by independent couriers; and
- Pay the restaurant’s menu price, applicable taxes, and a flat $9.99 delivery fee (paid entirely to the courier).

Peastash does **not** prepare, manufacture, package, or sell food. Peastash is **not** the merchant of record for food or beverage items. Restaurants are the sole sellers and merchants of record.

## 3. Merchant of Record

All food and beverage items offered on the Platform are sold directly by the participating restaurant, not by Peastash. The restaurant determines the menu items, descriptions, pricing, tax rate, and availability.

Peastash collects payment **on behalf of the restaurant** using Stripe Connect, and then transfers the menu price and applicable taxes to the restaurant, less its service fee. Restaurants are solely responsible for collecting, reporting, and remitting all taxes.

Peastash is a marketplace facilitator and payment collection agent, not a food seller.

## 4. Eligibility

To use Peastash, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old;
- Reside in the United States;
- Have legal capacity to enter into a contract; and
- Use the Platform for lawful purposes only.

## 5. Account Registration

You may need to create an account to use certain features. You agree to:

- Provide accurate and complete information;
- Maintain the security of your account credentials;
- Notify Peastash of any unauthorized use; and
- Not share your account with others.

Peastash may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms.

## 6. Ordering and Payment

### 6.1 Prices

All menu prices displayed on Peastash are provided directly by the restaurant.

### 6.2 Taxes

Sales tax is calculated and imposed by the restaurant, not by Peastash. Peastash collects tax on behalf of the restaurant and forwards it to the restaurant.

### 6.3 Delivery Fee

A flat **$9.99 delivery fee** applies to all orders. **100%** of this fee is paid to the courier who fulfills the delivery.

### 6.4 Payment Processing

Payments are processed securely through Stripe. By placing an order, you authorize Peastash (via Stripe) to:

- Charge your payment method;
- Collect payment for the restaurant;
- Transfer applicable amounts to restaurants and couriers; and
- Deduct Peastash service fees.

## 7. Delivery and Timing

Peastash couriers are independent contractors, not employees. Estimated delivery times are for convenience only and may vary due to restaurant preparation time, weather, traffic, courier availability, demand, or unforeseen events. Peastash is not liable for delays.

If the order arrives more than 30 minutes after the restaurant marks it “ready,” the delivery fee may be refunded at Peastash’s discretion.

## 8. Cancellations, Refunds, and Modifications

Orders cannot be modified after being placed. Refunds are limited to situations such as:

- Undelivered orders;
- Incorrect or missing items (restaurant responsibility);
- Delivery issues caused by the Platform or courier.

Peastash may require photographic evidence or verification. Restaurants are solely responsible for product quality, safety, allergen disclosure, and accuracy.

## 9. Restaurant Responsibilities

Restaurants on Peastash are solely responsible for:

- Menu accuracy and pricing;
- Ingredient and allergen information;
- Food preparation and safety;
- Packaging;
- Correct taxation; and
- Compliance with food service laws and regulations.

Peastash does not verify or guarantee the accuracy of restaurant information.

## 10. Courier Responsibilities

Deliveries are performed by independent couriers, who must be at least 18 years old, have passed a background check, and are approved by Peastash. Couriers are required to use bicycles only; use of unauthorized vehicles may be a violation of platform rules.

Couriers are not employees or agents of Peastash.

## 11. Platform License

Peastash grants you a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use the Platform for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.

- Use automated tools to scrape or access data; or
- Create multiple accounts to exploit promotions or incentives.

## 13. Disclaimers

The Peastash Platform is provided “**as is**” and “**as available**” without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Peastash does not warrant:

- Food quality or safety;
- Allergen safety or labeling accuracy;
- Delivery accuracy or timing;
- Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Platform.

## 14. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law, Peastash is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, including lost profits or data.

Peastash’s maximum liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Platform or these Terms is the lesser of **$100** or the value of the disputed order.

- Your use or misuse of the Platform;
- Your violation of these Terms;
- Disputes with restaurants or couriers; or
- Allergic reactions or food-related issues with restaurant products.

## 16. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration

You agree to resolve all disputes with Peastash through **binding individual arbitration**, and not in court or in a class or representative action.

### 16.1 No Class Actions

You waive any right to participate in a class action, class arbitration, or other representative proceeding.

### 16.2 Arbitration Rules

Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its applicable rules. You and Peastash will share arbitration fees as permitted by law.

### 16.3 Small Claims Exception

Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court where jurisdiction and amount limits allow.

## 17. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

## 18. Termination

Peastash may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform at any time for any reason, including but not limited to:

- Abuse toward drivers, restaurants, or support staff;
- Fraud or chargeback abuse;
- Violations of these Terms; or
- Safety incidents or misuse of the Platform.

## 19. Changes to Terms

Peastash may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes via email or app notification. Your continued use of the Platform after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
