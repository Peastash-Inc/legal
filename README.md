# Peastash Legal Hub

Peastash is a food delivery platform operated by **The Candeed Corp**, a New Jersey–based corporation.  
We exist to restore fairness, transparency, and simplicity to food delivery for customers, restaurants, and couriers.

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to make food delivery fair again.  
Customers should pay what the restaurant actually charges. Restaurants should keep their profits. Couriers should earn stable, guaranteed pay. Peastash brings all three together on a simple, transparent platform.

## Vision
We aim to become the most trusted and transparent food delivery system in America — a place where everyone involved in the process wins. No hidden fees, no inflated prices, no exploitation. Just real food delivered at real prices.

## About the Platform
Peastash connects customers with local restaurants and independent bicycle couriers.  
Customers pay the in-restaurant menu price, tax, and a flat $9.99 delivery fee — which goes **100% to the courier**.  
Restaurants pay a simple **6% service fee** based only on their weekly payouts.  
Couriers work independently, choose when they deliver, and receive the full delivery fee per order.
