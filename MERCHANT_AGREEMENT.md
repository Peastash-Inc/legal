# Peastash Merchant Agreement
_Last Updated: November 15, 2025_

This Merchant Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between **The Candeed Corp**, a New Jersey corporation doing business as **Peastash** (“Peastash,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), and the restaurant or business accepting this Agreement (“Merchant,” “you,” or “your”).

By listing your restaurant on the Peastash platform, you agree to the terms below.

---

# 1. Overview

Peastash is a marketplace and delivery facilitation platform. Peastash does not prepare, package, store, or sell food. Restaurants are the sole sellers and merchants of record for all food and beverage items.

Peastash provides order placement, payment collection, courier dispatch, and delivery facilitation through independent bicycle couriers.

Peastash does **not** support alcohol sales at this time.

# 2. Merchant of Record

You acknowledge and agree that:

- You are the **merchant of record** for all food and beverage items sold through Peastash.
- You determine menu pricing, ingredients, allergens, and taxes.
- You are responsible for:
  - Food preparation
  - Food safety and compliance with all local laws
  - Packaging and sealing
  - Ingredient and allergen disclosures
  - Menu accuracy
  - Sales tax calculation and remittance

Peastash does not verify menu accuracy, allergen statements, or tax rates.

# 3. Price Parity Requirement

All prices listed on Peastash must **match your in-store prices** offered to walk-in customers.

Examples:

- A $12.99 in-store burger must be $12.99 on Peastash.
- A $2.49 drink must be $2.49 on Peastash.

Peastash does not dictate your prices; we only require that the prices shown in the app be identical to the prices offered in person.

Peastash may adjust or suspend menu access if price parity is not maintained.

# 4. Payments, Fees, and Payout Schedule

## 4.1 Stripe Connect Required  
To receive payouts, the Merchant must maintain an active **Stripe Connect** account.  
You authorize Peastash and Stripe to:

- Collect customer payments on your behalf  
- Deduct applicable fees

## 4.2 Weekly Payout Schedule  
Peastash deposits the Merchant’s **net payout every Tuesday** for completed and settled orders from the previous payout period.

## 4.3 Service Fee (6%)  
Peastash charges a **6% service fee**, calculated **only on the final payout amount** after all adjustments, excluding sales tax.

The fee:

- Applies only to the **food subtotal actually received by the Merchant**

- Does not apply to the customer delivery fee  
- Is automatically deducted from the payout

Service fee (6% of $90): $5.40

# 5. Order Processing & Pickup Verification

## 5.1 Order Accuracy

- The courier must present the correct PIN to the restaurant at pickup.  
- The order cannot be marked as “picked up” in the system until the PIN is successfully verified.  
- Once verified, the system permanently records proof of handoff.

This system protects Merchants from:

- Disputes regarding whether an order left the store  

## 5.3 Packaging Standards  
Merchant agrees to:

- Use tamper-evident packaging

Couriers may decline pickups that appear unsafe or improperly sealed.
